# Factors-that-Fuel-Student-Performance

# Overview

In today’s dynamic educational landscape, it is critical to understand the key elements that contribute to student success. This project leverages data analysis to investigate the factors influencing academic performance among students, using a rich dataset covering aspects such as study habits, sleep, attendance, and more.

# Objectives

- To identify and analyse the key factors that impact student exam performance.
- To provide evidence-based insights that could aid students, teachers, and policymakers in enhancing academic outcomes.
- To utilise data-driven methods to inform educational strategies and resource allocation.

# Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is hosted on DataCamp’s DataLab platform, containing structured data on student behaviours and academic metrics.

# Tools Used

- SQL for querying and analysing the dataset.
- DataCamp DataLab for executing analysis in a cloud-based environment.

# Insights

- Exam performance tends to increase with the number of hours studied.
- Students who participate in extracurricular activities and receive quality tutoring generally perform better.
- Adequate sleep and high attendance rates show a positive correlation with higher exam scores.

# Key Findings

- Students who study for 16+ hours per week consistently achieve the highest average scores.
- High attendance rates and teacher quality are significant contributors to exam success.
- Tutoring sessions have a noticeable positive effect when combined with consistent study and sleep patterns.

# Recommendations

- Encourage consistent study schedules, aiming for at least 11–15 hours per week.
